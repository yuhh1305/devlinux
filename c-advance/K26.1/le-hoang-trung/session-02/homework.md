# Assignment — Session 02: Memory Layout & Stack Analysis
**Deadline: 2026-07-05 23:59:00**

## Exercise_1 [build]

### Problem Statement

**Memory Segment Analyzer — Map, Measure, and Verify**

**Scenario:**
In embedded systems, understanding exactly where your data lives in memory is not academic — it directly impacts performance, debuggability, and safety. A firmware engineer who cannot map variables to memory segments will struggle to diagnose stack overflows, heap corruption, and linker errors that are common in bare-metal and RTOS environments.

**Objective:**
Write a C program that declares variables in **each memory segment** (text/rodata, data, BSS, heap, stack), prints their addresses, and calculates the distance between segments using pointer arithmetic. Then verify your findings using `size` and `nm`.

**Requirements:**

Implement a function with the following prototype:

```c
void print_memory_map(void);
```

**Rules:**
- Declare at least one variable in each segment:
  - `.text` — function pointer (e.g., address of `main` or `print_memory_map`)
  - `.rodata` — `const` global variable (e.g., `const uint32_t global_const = 100;`)
  - `.data` — initialized global variable (e.g., `uint32_t global_init = 42;`)
  - `.bss` — uninitialized global variable (e.g., `uint32_t global_uninit;`)
  - heap — dynamically allocated variable using `malloc()`
  - stack — local variable inside a function
- Print the address of each variable using `printf` with `%p` format specifier and proper `(void *)` cast.
- Calculate and print the distance (in bytes) between segments using `uintptr_t` arithmetic from `<stdint.h>`.
- Free all dynamically allocated memory before the program exits.
- Follow BARR-C coding style (fixed-width integers, mandatory braces, pointer naming with `p_` prefix, Doxygen comments).
- Use `cppcheck` and `clang-tidy` to analysis, and make sure there are no warning or error message.
- Compile with strict flags: `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror -std=c99`.

### Coding Standards Reference

This exercise is a good opportunity to study the following industry rules. You don't need to memorize them — read the rule, understand *why* it exists, and apply the pattern in your code.

**MISRA-C 2012 (Safety):**
| Rule | Category | Relevance to This Exercise |
|---|---|---|
| Directive 4.12 | Required | Dynamic memory allocation shall not be used → you are using `malloc()`/`free()` in this exercise. Understand **why** MISRA forbids this in safety-critical systems (heap fragmentation, out-of-memory risk) even though this exercise requires it for learning. |
| Rule 9.1 | Mandatory | The value of an object with automatic storage duration shall not be read before it has been set → initialize all local (stack) variables before printing their addresses or values. |
| Rule 11.4 | Advisory | A conversion should not be performed between a pointer to object and an integer type → casting addresses to `uintptr_t` for distance calculations exercises this rule. Use `uintptr_t` from `<stdint.h>` as the safe integer type for pointer values. |
| Rule 11.6 | Required | A cast shall not be performed between pointer to void and an arithmetic type → `malloc()` returns `void *`; be careful when casting it. |
| Rule 22.1 | Required | All memory that is allocated dynamically shall be explicitly released → every `malloc()` must have a matching `free()`. |

**CERT-C 2016 (Security):**
| Rule | Relevance to This Exercise |
|---|---|
| EXP34-C | Do not dereference null pointers → check that `malloc()` does not return `NULL` before using the heap pointer. |
| EXP36-C | Do not cast pointers into more strictly aligned pointer types → be careful with pointer type conversions when printing addresses. |
| MEM30-C | Do not access freed memory → after calling `free()`, do not use the pointer again. Set it to `NULL` after freeing. |
| MEM31-C | Free dynamically allocated memory when no longer needed → ensure all `malloc()`'d memory is freed before program exit. |
| ERR33-C | Detect and handle standard library errors → `malloc()` can fail; check its return value. |

> **How to use:** Open the MISRA-C 2012 and CERT-C 2016 PDFs (under `C_Books/`) and read the full description of each rule above. After writing your code, verify your implementation follows these rules.


### Expected Output

Addresses will vary on your machine, but the format should be:

```
=== Memory Segment Map ===
[TEXT]   Address of main():            0x55a3b4001169
[RODATA] Address of global_const:      0x55a3b4002004
[DATA]   Address of global_init:       0x55a3b4004010
[BSS]    Address of global_uninit:     0x55a3b4004018
[HEAP]   Address of heap_var:          0x55a3b52922a0
[STACK]  Address of stack_var:         0x7ffd8b3e1a2c

=== Segment Distances ===
RODATA - TEXT:   ... bytes
DATA   - RODATA: ... bytes
BSS    - DATA:   ... bytes
HEAP   - BSS:    ... bytes
STACK  - HEAP:   ... bytes
```

Exit code: `0` on success, non-zero on error.

### Verification Step (Required)

After compiling, run the following commands and **include the output as a comment block** at the bottom of your `main.c`:

1. **`size` output** — shows text/data/bss segment sizes:
   ```bash
   size <your_binary>
   ```

2. **`nm` output** — verify at least 2 variables are in the expected segment:
   ```bash
   nm <your_binary> | grep -i global_init
   nm <your_binary> | grep -i global_uninit
   ```
   Look for the segment letter: `D` = data, `B` = BSS, `R` = rodata, `T` = text.

## Exercise_2 [build]

### Problem Statement

**Stack Depth Monitor — Measure Stack Usage & Detect Overflow Risk**

**Scenario:**
Stack overflow is one of the most dangerous runtime failures in embedded systems — it silently corrupts memory and causes unpredictable crashes that are extremely hard to debug. In RTOS environments (FreeRTOS, Zephyr), each task has a fixed-size stack, and knowing exactly how much stack a function chain consumes is critical for setting safe stack sizes.

**Objective:**
Write a C program that implements a recursive function which monitors stack depth by recording the address of a local variable at each recursion level. The program must detect when stack consumption exceeds a configurable threshold and stop recursion safely — **before** a real stack overflow occurs.

**Requirements:**

Implement a function with the following prototype:

```c
int8_t recurse_with_monitor(uint32_t current_depth, uint32_t max_depth,
                             const uintptr_t stack_base_addr,
                             uint32_t stack_limit_bytes);
```

**Rules:**
- At each recursion level, declare a local variable (e.g., `uint8_t stack_marker;`) and record its address.
- Calculate current stack usage as the distance between `stack_base_addr` (captured in `main`) and the current `stack_marker` address.
- If stack usage exceeds `stack_limit_bytes`, print a warning and return an error code **without** recursing further (safe abort).
- Print the recursion depth, local variable address, and current stack usage at each level.
- Return `0` on success (max depth reached), or `-1` if the stack limit was hit.
- The `stack_base_addr` should be captured in `main()` using the address of a local variable cast to `uintptr_t`.
- Follow BARR-C coding style (fixed-width integers, mandatory braces, pointer naming with `p_` prefix, Doxygen comments).
- Use `cppcheck` and `clang-tidy` to analysis, and make sure there are no warning or error message.
- Compile with strict flags: `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror -std=c99`.

### Coding Standards Reference

This exercise is a good opportunity to study the following industry rules. You don't need to memorize them — read the rule, understand *why* it exists, and apply the pattern in your code.

**MISRA-C 2012 (Safety):**
| Rule | Category | Relevance to This Exercise |
|---|---|---|
| Directive 4.1 | Required | Run-time failures shall be minimized → stack overflow is a run-time failure. This exercise teaches you to **detect** it before it happens. |
| Rule 9.1 | Mandatory | The value of an object with automatic storage duration shall not be read before it has been set → initialize the `stack_marker` variable and all local variables before use. |
| Rule 11.4 | Advisory | A conversion should not be performed between a pointer to object and an integer type → you must cast `&stack_marker` to `uintptr_t` for stack distance arithmetic. Understand why this is necessary. |
| Rule 17.2 | Required | Functions shall not call themselves, either directly or indirectly (no recursion) → **This exercise intentionally uses recursion**. Study this rule and document in a comment **why** MISRA forbids recursion (unbounded stack growth) and how your `stack_limit_bytes` guard makes this usage controlled and safe. |
| Rule 15.5 | Advisory | A function should have a single point of exit → the function has multiple exit conditions (base case + stack limit); consider how to structure them. |

**CERT-C 2016 (Security):**
| Rule | Relevance to This Exercise |
|---|---|
| MEM05-C | Avoid large stack allocations → recursive functions consume stack per call. This is the core lesson: monitor and limit stack consumption to prevent exhaustion. |
| EXP34-C | Do not dereference null pointers → validate any pointer parameters if the design is extended. |
| INT32-C | Ensure that operations on signed integers do not result in overflow → stack depth calculations and comparisons with `stack_limit_bytes` must not overflow. Use unsigned types (`uint32_t`, `uintptr_t`). |
| ARR30-C | Do not form or use out-of-bounds pointers or array subscripts → if you store recursion data in an array for tracking, enforce bounds. |
| EXP33-C | Do not read uninitialized memory → the `stack_marker` variable and all tracking variables must be initialized before use. |

> **How to use:** Open the MISRA-C 2012 and CERT-C 2016 PDFs and read the full description of each rule above. After writing your code, verify your implementation follows these rules.

### Design Hints (optional)

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdio.h>

/**
 * @brief Monitor stack depth during recursion and abort if limit is exceeded.
 *
 * @param[in] current_depth     Current recursion depth (starts at 0).
 * @param[in] max_depth         Maximum recursion depth to attempt.
 * @param[in] stack_base_addr   Address of a local variable in main(), cast to uintptr_t.
 * @param[in] stack_limit_bytes Maximum allowed stack consumption in bytes.
 * @return 0 on success (max_depth reached), -1 if stack limit was exceeded.
 */
int8_t recurse_with_monitor(uint32_t current_depth, uint32_t max_depth,
                             const uintptr_t stack_base_addr,
                             uint32_t stack_limit_bytes);
```

### Suggested Approach (optional)

```
1. In main(): declare a local variable, capture its address as stack_base_addr
2. Call recurse_with_monitor(0, 100, stack_base_addr, 4096)
3. In recurse_with_monitor():
   a. Declare local uint8_t stack_marker
   b. Calculate: stack_used = stack_base_addr - (uintptr_t)&stack_marker
   c. Print depth, address, and stack_used
   d. If stack_used >= stack_limit_bytes → print WARNING, return -1
   e. If current_depth >= max_depth → return 0 (success)
   f. Otherwise → recurse: return recurse_with_monitor(current_depth + 1, ...)
4. In main(): print the final result
```

### Expected Output

Addresses will vary, but the format should be:

```
=== Stack Depth Monitor (limit: 4096 bytes) ===
[Depth  0] stack_marker addr: 0x7ffd8b3e1a00, stack used:    0 bytes
[Depth  1] stack_marker addr: 0x7ffd8b3e19c0, stack used:   64 bytes
[Depth  2] stack_marker addr: 0x7ffd8b3e1980, stack used:  128 bytes
...
[Depth 63] stack_marker addr: 0x7ffd8b3e0a00, stack used: 4032 bytes
[Depth 64] WARNING: Stack usage (4096 bytes) exceeds limit! Aborting recursion.
Result: -1 (stack limit reached at depth 64)
```

Exit code: `0` on success, non-zero on error.
