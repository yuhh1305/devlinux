## Exercise_1 [build]

### Problem Statement

**Safe Network Address Parser — IPv4 to `uint32_t`**

**Scenario:**
In embedded networking (e.g., IoT firmware), we often receive network settings as ASCII strings from a configuration file, CLI, or web interface. We must parse these strings into numeric values safely without triggering undefined behavior.

**Efficiency (Storage & CPU Speed) Reasons:**
- **Memory footprint:** The string `"192.168.1.50"` takes 13 bytes in memory (12 characters + `\0` null terminator). A `uint32_t` takes exactly 4 bytes.
- **CPU Comparison Speed:** If a router needs to check if a packet's destination IP matches a routing rule, comparing strings requires calling `strcmp()` (which loops character by character). This is extremely slow. Comparing two `uint32_t` integers takes one CPU instruction (a simple assembly-level `CMP` instruction). When processing millions of packets per second, string comparisons would crash the network.

**Requirements:**

Write a C program that implements an IPv4 address parser with the following prototype:

```c
int8_t parse_ipv4(const char *ip_str, uint32_t *p_ip_out);
```

**Rules:**
- Check for `NULL` pointers defensively.
- Ensure the IP address components are valid (0 to 255).
- Return `0` on success, or a negative error code (e.g., `-1`) if the format is invalid.
- Avoid unsafe standard library functions like `atoi()` (which has undefined behavior on overflow). Use safe parsing logic instead.
- Follow BARR-C coding style (fixed-width integers, mandatory braces, pointer naming with `p_` prefix, Doxygen comments).
- Use `cppcheck` and `clang-tidy` to analysis, and make sure there are no warning or error message.
- Compile with strict flags: `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror -std=c99`.

### Coding Standards Reference

This exercise is a good opportunity to study the following industry rules. You don't need to memorize them — read the rule, understand *why* it exists, and apply the pattern in your code.

**MISRA-C 2012 (Safety):**
| Rule | Category | Relevance to This Exercise |
|---|---|---|
| Directive 4.11 | Required | The validity of values passed to library functions shall be checked → validate `ip_str` and `p_ip_out` for `NULL` before use. |
| Directive 4.12 | Required | Dynamic memory allocation shall not be used → use stack-based buffers and fixed-width integers only. |
| Directive 4.14 | Required | The validity of values received from external sources shall be checked → the IP string comes from untrusted input; every parsed octet must be validated (0–255, exactly 4 octets, correct `.` delimiters). |
| Rule 9.1 | Mandatory | The value of an object with automatic storage duration shall not be read before it has been set → initialize all local variables (e.g., `uint32_t ip_out = 0;`). |
| Rule 10.3 | Required | The value of an expression shall not be assigned to an object with a narrower essential type → be careful when converting parsed octet values (potentially `int`) into `uint8_t` range (0–255). |
| Rule 15.5 | Advisory | A function should have a single point of exit at the end → consider structuring early-return error checks carefully. |
| Rule 21.7 | Required | The Standard Library functions `atof`, `atoi`, `atol` and `atoll` shall not be used → implement your own safe parsing logic instead. |

**CERT-C 2016 (Security):**
| Rule | Relevance to This Exercise |
|---|---|
| EXP34-C | Do not dereference null pointers → validate `ip_str` and `p_ip_out` before dereferencing. |
| ARR30-C | Do not form or use out-of-bounds pointers or array subscripts → ensure character-by-character parsing never reads past the `\0` terminator. |
| INT32-C | Ensure that operations on signed integers do not result in overflow → when accumulating octet values (e.g., `octet = octet * 10 + digit`), validate range before the arithmetic. |
| INT31-C | Ensure that integer conversions do not result in lost or misinterpreted data → validate octet value fits in `uint8_t` range before narrowing conversion; careful when assembling 4 octets into `uint32_t`. |
| MSC24-C | Do not use deprecated or obsolescent functions → `atoi()` cannot report errors; use safe character-by-character parsing instead. |
| ERR33-C | Detect and handle standard library errors → check return values of any library calls used. |
| STR31-C | Guarantee that storage for strings has sufficient space for character data and the null terminator → applies if you copy parts of the IP string into local buffers. |

> **How to use:** Open the MISRA-C 2012 and CERT-C 2016 PDFs and read the full description of each rule above. After writing your code, verify your implementation follows these rules.


### Design Hints (optional)

```c
#include <stdint.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

/**
 * @brief Parse an IPv4 address string into a 32-bit unsigned integer.
 *
 * @param[in]  ip_str    Null-terminated ASCII string (e.g., "192.168.1.50").
 * @param[out] p_ip_out  Pointer to store the parsed 32-bit IP address.
 * @return 0 on success, -1 on invalid input.
 */
int8_t parse_ipv4(const char *ip_str, uint32_t *p_ip_out);
```

### Expected Output

```
parse_ipv4("192.168.1.50", &ip_out)  -> returns  0, ip_out = 0xC0A80132 (3232235826)
parse_ipv4("256.0.0.1",    &ip_out)  -> returns -1  (octet out of range)
parse_ipv4(NULL,            &ip_out)  -> returns -1  (NULL input)
```

Exit code: `0` on success, non-zero on error.

## Exercise_2 [build]

### Problem Statement

**Safe Network Address Parser — MAC Address to `uint8_t[6]`**

**Scenario:**
Same embedded networking scenario as Exercise 1. Here, we parse MAC addresses received as ASCII strings into a 6-byte array safely, without triggering undefined behavior.

**Requirements:**

Write a C program that implements a MAC address parser with the following prototype:

```c
int8_t parse_mac(const char *mac_str, uint8_t *p_mac_out);
```

**Rules:**
- Check for `NULL` pointers defensively.
- Support both uppercase and lowercase hex digits (`0-9`, `a-f`, `A-F`).
- Validate structure (ensure correct placement of `:` or `-` delimiters).
- Ensure you do not overflow `p_mac_out` or perform pointer arithmetic past the end of the input string (`mac_str`).
- Return `0` on success, or a negative error code on failure.
- Follow BARR-C coding style (fixed-width integers, mandatory braces, pointer naming with `p_` prefix, Doxygen comments).
- Use `cppcheck` and `clang-tidy` to analysis, and make sure there are no warning or error message.
- Compile with strict flags: `-Wall -Wextra -pedantic -Werror -std=c99`.

| ARR38-C | Guarantee that library functions do not form invalid pointers → applies when using pointer arithmetic to walk through the MAC string. |
| INT32-C | Ensure that operations on signed integers do not result in overflow → validate hex digit values before arithmetic conversion. |
